# Introduction

SUPERHEROES is a learning project, providing basic out-of-the-box capabilities
for learners to build upon.

This project is a MERN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, Node.js) application made
of two processes:
   1. an Express "server" providing API support for retrieving and submitting
   data from the backend
   1. a React "client" providing a web-based UI

This project also leverages a cloud-based instance of MongoDB for storing
and retrieving data.

# Working with this Codebase

## Get the code

1. Start a command shell (CMD, PowerShell, Terminal, etc.)
1. Make a directory for your work: `mkdir my_work`
1. `cd my_work`
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/gregfenton/evolveu-superheroes.git`
1. `cd evolveu-superheroes`
1. Start VS Code for this project: `code .`
1. Now start the Express server and the React client (see next sections)

## Starting the Express server

In a command shell run the commands:
1. `cd server`
1. `npm install`
1. `npm run start`

The server is now running on port *3000*.

## Starting the React client

In a command shell run the commands:
1. `cd client`
1. `npm install`
1. `npm run start`

Your browser should open to `http://localhost:4444`.  The React development
system is running on port *4444*.  You should now see a web app showing a
list of four (4) superheroes.  That data is coming from a
publically-readable MongoDB running in the cloud.

# Using your own MongoDB instance

You can run MongoDB locally on your machine or you can sign up for a no-cost(!)
account at `https://www.mongodb.com/`.

Once you have your MongoDB instance set up, simply edit the login information
that is found in `server/app.js` under the comment `// SETUP MONGO/MONGOOSE`.

For example, if you are using a local install you might set:

```js
const mongoUser = 'dbUser';
const mongoPasswd = 'hideMe!!';
const mongoDBName = 'my_mongo_db';
const mongoServer = 'localhost:27017';
```

You might add the initial data used in the public MongoDB instance:

```js
[
  {name: "Batwoman", nickname: null, alterego: "Kate Kane", sidekick: "Batgirl"},
  {name: "Bat-Girl", nickname: null, alterego: "Betty Kane", sidekick: null},
  {name: "Batman", nickname: "The Batman", alterego: "Bruce Wayne", sidekick: "Robin"},
  {name: "Robin", nickname: "The Boy Wonder", alterego: "Dick Grayson", sidekick: null},
]
```

# How this project was created

> **NOTE**: you only want to review this section if you are going to create
an entirely new project leveraging the same technologies and approach used for
this project

Here are the command-line steps taken to create the initial version of this project:
```bash
$ mkdir superheroes
$ cd superheroes
$ npx create-react-app --use-npm client
$ npx express-generator server
$ rm -rf client/.git client/.gitignore client/yarn.k
$ rm server/.gitignore
$ cat <<- EOF > .gitignore

   Changes to be committed:
     (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
          new file:   .gitignore
          new file:   README.md
          new file:   client/.env
          new file:   client/README.md
          new file:   client/package-lock.json

          new file:   client/src/index.css
          new file:   client/src/index.js
          new file:   client/src/logo.svg

          new file:   server/public/stylesheets/style.css
          new file:   server/routes/index.js
          new file:   server/routes/users.js
          new file:   server/views/error.jade
          new file:   server/views/index.jade
          new file:   server/views/layout.jade
$ git commit -m "initialize the project"
```

Now, we additionally enabled `nodemon` to reload the server code when it gets
edited.  To do that:
```bash
$ cd server
$ npm install --save-dev nodemon
$ perl -p -i -e 's/"start": "node /"start": "nodemon /' package.json
$ git add package.json 
$ git commit -m "adding nodemon to speed development"
$ cd ..
```
